<h3 id="how-to-install-opam-health-check">How to install opam-health-check:</h3>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ opam pin add opam-health-check .
</code></pre><h3 id="how-to-use-opam-health-check-locally">How to use opam-health-check locally:</h3>
<p>For opam-health-check to work you need to start the server like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ opam-health-serve --connect &#34;$ocluster_cap&#34; &#34;$workdir&#34;
</code></pre><p>For instance:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ workdir=/tmp/opam-health-check
$ ocluster_cap=&#34;$HOME/ocluster.cap&#34;
$ opam-health-serve --connect &#34;$ocluster_cap&#34; &#34;$workdir&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now simply use the <code>opam-health-check</code> command. First you need to initialize it like so:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ opam-health-check init --from-local-workdir &#34;$workdir&#34;
</code></pre><p>Now you can send any command to the server using the <code>opam-health-check</code> command.
All subcommands may be listed with <code>opam-health-check --help</code></p>
<h3 id="ocluster-capability-file">OCluster capability file</h3>
<p>opam-health-check now uses OCluster for its daily use. This means you need
access to an OCluster instance with its dedicated capability file, which is
given to the server through the <code>--connect</code> option.</p>
<p>To set this up locally, you will need to get run the OCluster scheduler and one or more workers. The
sequence of steps is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the OCluster scheduler probably with the public address <code>tcp:127.0.0.1:9000</code>.</li>
<li>Use the OCluster admin command to generate the submission capability for
opam-health-check, it will most likely be something like
<pre tabindex="0"><code>$ ocluster-admin add-client --connect ./capnp-secrets/admin.cap opam-health-check &gt; ~/ocluster.cap`.
</code></pre></li>
<li>Add a new worker to the pool you are using.</li>
<li>Run <code>opam-health-serve</code>.</li>
<li>Initialise <code>opam-health-check</code> as described above, add some opam switches and
then run the checks.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-to-use-opam-health-check-remotely">How to use opam-health-check remotely:</h3>
<p>As with local opam-health-check you need to have a server started somewhere and accessible.
Don&rsquo;t forget to open the admin and http ports. Default ports are respectively 6666 and 8080.
You can change them by modifying the yaml config file at the root of the work directory and
restarting the server.</p>
<p>During the first run the server creates an admin user and its key.
To connect to the server remotely just you first need to retreive the <code>admin.key</code> file located
in <code>&lt;workdir&gt;/keys/admin.key</code> and do <code>opam-health-check init</code>.
From there, answer all the questions (hostname, admin-port (default: 6666), username (admin)
and the path to the user key you just retreived).
You now have your client tool configured with an admin user!</p>
<p>To add new users, just use the <code>opam-health-check add-user &lt;username&gt;</code> command as the admin and
give the key to your new user. She now just need to do the same procedure but with her username.</p>
<p>Side note: every user have the same rights and can add new users.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
